# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description

This repo contains a (very basic, work in progress) portfolio that I created from scratch to showcase my other projects.  The portfolio contains an about me section, a section containing my work, as well as a section for contact. I made sure to make the links functional, style the page to flow well, and included media compatibility for smaller screens. I created an HTML, a reset CSS sheet and a style CSS sheet, and used VSC to make any changes, as well as gitbash to push and commit. The follwoing screenshot shows the final page.

## Installation

## Usage

The porfolio is used to display my web development work. Although it is small right now, it will grow and will hopefully be useful for potential employers. As I learn more techniques, I will go back and apply them to this page to demonstrate my advancing skills.
